# LIMITATIONS

The current puppet-iis module lacks the ability to finely configure site created by it. It's great for quickly creating an IIS site if you're not 
going to be heavily customising.

Dependency
This module is dependent on other modules being installed and configured correctly before you can fully utilise it. Dependencies can add another
layer of complexity to the deployment solution.

The Web-Administration only supports IIS 7.5 and upwards meaning it cannot be used in an environment where there's legacy windows servers.
Web-Administration module is also limited in the sense that you still won't be able to gain fine control over the configuration of the site without
using other PS modules i.e. New-ItemProperty, Set-ItemProperty et al.

IMPROVEMENTS
This really depends on what I am trying achieve. If I want to be able to;

a. Create IIS sites quickly
b. Not interested in fine grain configuration

Then this is the perfect module for that type of operation. However as an engineer I don't want to be using too many tools to achieve an end goal.
The ability to use a single module would cut down the amount of time spent going back and forth between different modules to figure out which one is causing a problem.

With that thought in mind I would aim to reduce the dependencies of this module if possible and work on adding features to improve the capabilities and functionality.
